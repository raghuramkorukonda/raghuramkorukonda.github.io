I am certified in Microsoft Azure and App Development. I am experienced in application development and Azure cloud implementation and worked on Infrastructure provisioning using ARM/Powershell/CLI/SDK/API, Migration of Applications/Infra, Backup workloads, Application Insights, etc.

I spend most of my time between contributing to Microsoft Azure as well as other Open Source communities. I am passionate about Technology and helping people in embracing it to the fullest.

In my spare time, I love developing products which includes an Integrator to push Azure Audit Logs, SaaS based Application to showcase Azure Billing with detailed insights on Cloud spendings, Web Application which displays Virtual machine Utilizations and Customized Automated Azure Backup Solution using Powershell Scripts.
